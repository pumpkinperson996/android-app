My app, which will allow users to rate public toilets, exemplifies innovation by introducing a new concept of leveraging user-generated content to improve public facilities. This includes
Real-time feedback mechanism: Providing real-time reviews and ratings can significantly enhance the decision-making process for users who require clean and accessible facilities.
Community-driven data: Leverage user-generated content to build a comprehensive database of public restroom reviews not commonly seen in mainstream apps.
Quality control and maintenance insights: Facilities can use data to improve their maintenance processes based on user feedback.

As for cloud services, developing such applications can take advantage of:
Database service: A cloud-based database such as Amazon RDS or Google Firebase to store user reviews and restroom information.
Compute service: AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions are used for backend processing of the application, such as handling requests, notifications, and data processing.
Authentication services: Services like AWS Cognito or Firebase Authentication securely manage user accounts.
